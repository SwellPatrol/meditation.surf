This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

### Node setup (NVM and npm)

Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
```

Then install the required Node version and set it as the default:

```sh
nvm install 24
nvm use 24
```

npm is installed with Node and is only used to install pnpm globally.

### pnpm setup

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager. If you don't have it installed, you can install it globally with:

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start the app

```bash
pnpm start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app:

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
